In 2014, after many years of working in the political and activist
sectors, I opened this firm with the intent of providing legal services to
the most vulnerable people in Long Beach and throughout Southern
California.

Growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, attending college in Boston,
Massachusetts, and starting my professional life in Memphis, Tennessee
taught me about the constant (and at times tragic) struggle for equality
and justice in and outside of our judicial system.

I was raised all over this country, but mainly in some of Americaâ€™s most
economically disadvantaged and racially segregated cities.

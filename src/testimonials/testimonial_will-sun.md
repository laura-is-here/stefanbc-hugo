Stefan has been counsel to Curated Cannabis for the past 18 months,
helping us transition from a Prop 215 collective to a Prop 64 licensed
commercial cannabis company. Stefan helped us secure our processor
license (first in Orange County), distributor license (first in Orange
County), and manufacturing license. He's both a pro and an unabashed
cannabis enthusiast. Stefan is our first call on all legal,
regulatory, and political matters.

This guide will walk you through how to best utilize Forestry CMS to manage content for your site.

This article is live on your site now, so you'll get to see what it's like to make edits in real time and get used to how those edits affect your site as a whole.

Let's get editing!

## Getting Started

### Choosing some content to edit

You'll see a page like this when you sign into Forestry CMS

You'll use the sidebar on the left to get to editing content. This is a CMS (Content Management System) after all, so let's jump right into editing some content!

Navigate to the "Practice Areas" section on the sidebar.

You should see a list of content already created in that section, like this:

Click on "How to Use Forestry CMS to Update Content on Your Site" and let's make some edits!

### Editing data for your content

After clicking the "How to Use Forestry CMS..." article, you should be looking at two panels.

The left panel controls important data for each piece of content you add. Some of this data will be included directly in the content you are editing, and some of it will be used in other places on your site.

Let's take a look at the field that contains the **Title** for this piece of content.

Since this page is live on your site, you can see how the **Title** field is used here...

here...

and here.

It's also the title of this page itself, of course! But we'll get to that part more later.

You might notice that the cards for other content on your site have nice little excerpts describing what a user can expect to find on the other end of the title link.

Luckily, we can add a little excerpt of our own in the **Excerpt** field, right below **Title.**

Add the following to the **Excerpt** data field:

    This page will give you all the pointers you need to get editing content with Forestry CMS.

Click the save button in the top-right corner of the screen to save your changes. Your site should just take a few minutes to update with your new excerpt:

### Editing the content of your page

Let's take a look at the editor panel on the right.

Here is where you'll write more long-form content. The editor is **What You See Is What You Get,** which means that the bold text your write here will be bold on your page.

You can use the dock at the bottom of the panel to access formatting. Just hover over each to get an idea of what it does!

Again, once you're done making edits, just click the save button in the top-right corner and your site will be updated in just a few minutes.

#### A note on headings & SEO

You may have noticed that you have access to different **heading levels** from Forestry's formatting palette.

Headings are for a lot more than just highlighting certain text---they should give your content **organization and hierarchy,** both for human users and **bots.**

Some of these bots look at headings to determine what your content is about, which affects --- you guessed it --- SEO.

The most important takeaways:

* Use headings to organize your content
* Make sure your use of headings make sense and has some sense of hierarchy (i.e. this section is under the **A note on headings & SEO,** which is an H4, and is itself under the **Editing the content of your page** section, which is an H3, etc.)
* **Do NOT use any level 1 headings in this editor!** The title of your post (from the data, i.e. **How to Use Forestry CMS...**) will be be used as the first level heading in your content

We'll talk about how to add new content and other content types in another article. For now, get editing!

This article is live on your site now, so you'll get to see what it's like to make edits in real time and get used to how those edits affect your site as a whole.

Let's get editing!

## Getting Started

### Choosing some content to edit

You'll see a page like this when you sign into Forestry CMS

You'll use the sidebar on the left to get to editing content. This is a CMS (Content Management System) after all, so let's jump right into editing some content!

Navigate to the "Practice Areas" section on the sidebar.

You should see a list of content already created in that section, like this:

Click on "How to Use Forestry CMS to Update Content on Your Site" and let's make some edits!

### Editing data for your content

Let's take a look at the field that contains the **Title** for this piece of content.

Since this page is live on your site, you can see how the **Title** field is used here...

It's also the title of this page itself, of course! But we'll get to that part more later.

You might notice that the cards for other content on your site have nice little excerpts describing what a user can expect to find on the other end of the title link.

Luckily, we can add a little excerpt of our own in the **Excerpt** field, right below **Title.**

Add the following to the **Excerpt** data field:

Hey, someone left a job brochure here. 'Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...' you see. (By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...) ...Witness. Let's continue... Well, maybe it was a typo! It might have said, 'Spaghetti Festival'. What do you think? (Boy... this poor kid doesn't have a clue...)

The water pressure's kind of low in that shower. Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby! I believe the correct term here is 'You fail!' Witness, you've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.

I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip. ('Judge Has Active Imagination'... end quote.) I-I should have been more careful. G-Gumtree...? Gum doesn't grow on trees, pal! Oh, wait. You must mean 'puppet' as in someone forced to do his bidding... Nevermind! Godot. The prosecutor whose equal cannot be found in this country, but in heaven. Godot. A legend or myth... Men pin a lifetime of hopes on the chance to simply meet him. …Not exactly, but yeah, something like that. Even now… 6 years later, I can hardly believe it. She was going to do it… She was planning to kill me…
